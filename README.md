# capstone-data-analytics

This project investigates the key factors that influence housing affordability across cities in Arizona.

  - Median Household Income  
  - Median Home Price  
  - Median Rent  
  - Labor Force Participation  
  - Price-to-Income  
  - Population  
  - Relate to affordability outcomes across East and West Valley cities.  

The project includes:

  - Statistical hypothesis testing (H11–H14)  
  - Correlation analysis using Python (SciPy)  
  - Data cleaning and transformation  
  - Price-to-Income affordability scoring  
  - City-level comparison visualizations  

Power BI dashboards for geographic and metric-based exploration  

This study aims to provide a clear, data-driven understanding of housing market pressures and affordability challenges in Arizona.

## Instructions

Follow these steps to run the Python portion of this project locally:

1. **Install Python / Anaconda**  
   Download and install Anaconda (recommended) or any Python environment that supports Jupyter:
   - https://www.anaconda.com

2. **Download the Project Files**  
   Make sure to download:
   - All datasets listed in the **Data Sources** section  
   - The Python file located in the scripts folder  
   - Any Excel or CSV files included in the repository  

3. **Open a Python Reader (Jupyter Lab / Notebook)**  
   Launch Jupyter Lab (Anaconda Navigator → Launch Jupyter Lab).

4. **Match File Paths**  
   Ensure that the Jupyter working directory is the same folder where your Excel/CSV files are downloaded.  
   If files are in a different folder, move them into the same directory as the Python script.

5. **Run the Code**
   - Open the .ipynb notebook in Jupyter  
   - Run the code from **top to bottom**, or choose **Run All**  
   - Make sure there are no missing file or library errors

6. **View Results**
   - Outputs appear in the Jupyter console and charts window  
   - Cleaned data files and metrics are generated automatically  
   - Visualizations will display within the notebook
